  The Social Data Science of Healthcare Supply
</h1>
<br>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This project aims to harmonize data from across all Clinical Comissioning Groups. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) were created following the Health and Social Care Act in 2012, and replaced Primary Care Trusts on 1 April 2013. They are clinically-led statutory NHS bodies responsible for the planning and commissioning of health care services for their local area, essentially organising the delivery of NHS services in England. There have been approximately ten CCG mergers since 2015, and there currently remains 191 CCGs (down from 211 at the end of March 2013). <br>
<br>

As part of a renewed transparency drive, all CCG's are mandated by government to make available their spending above Â£25k. It was announced by David Cameron in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/letter-to-government-departments-on-opening-up-data">June 2010</a>, with <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/662332/guidance_for_publishing_spend.pdf">detailed guidance</a> outlining exactly what was expected, and from which public sector institutions. While the data is made available in a heterogenous, decentralised and un-harmonized way, it is possible with a range of tools to gain insight into the procurement process.
<br>

<br>
NHS Spend is therefore a set of full-stack tools to undertake a number of functions. It firstly scrapes all data from each individual CCG website. It then cleans and harmonizes the data, retaining seven key peieces of infornmation about each element of procurement:

<ul id="scrape-evaluation">
  <li>1. Supplier Name: The name of the entity supplying the CCG.</li>
  <li>2. Date of Spend: The date of spend.</li>
  <li>3. Amount: total value of individual payment (either including or excluding VAT).</li>
  <li>4. Expenses Area: the part of the entity that has spent the money.</li>
  <li>5. Expense Type: the general nature of the expenditure being recorded.</li>
  <li>6. Transaction Number: the system transaction number for the payment held by the institution.</li>
  <li>7. CCG Name: The name of the CCG making the procurement.</li>
</ul>
